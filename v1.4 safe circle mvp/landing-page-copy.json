      {
        "question": "How does SafeCircle monitor my activities without invading my privacy?",
        "answer": "SafeCircle uses patterns from your existing devices (phone unlocks, smart lights, thermostat adjustments) without cameras or location tracking. We don't see what you're doing—just that you're doing your normal routine. The system learns your patterns over the first week and only alerts contacts when something is genuinely unusual."
      },
      {
        "question": "What triggers a notification to my trusted contacts?",
        "answer": "Notifications are sent when SafeCircle detects a significant deviation from your normal routine—for example, no phone activity for 18 hours when you typically check it every few hours, or no smart home activity during times you're usually active. You can always respond to confirm you're fine and prevent unnecessary worry."
      },
      {
        "question": "How secure is my information in the Legacy Planner?",
        "answer": "We use military-grade encryption and bank-level security protocols. You can require biometric verification (fingerprint or face recognition) before trusted contacts can access your information. We never sell your data, and you control exactly what's stored and who can access it."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I don't have any smart home devices?",
        "answer": "Your smartphone alone provides valuable monitoring data through usage patterns. However, adding even one smart device (like a $10 smart plug for a lamp) significantly improves detection accuracy. We'll help you identify affordable options during setup."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I change my trusted contacts later?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. You can add, remove, or change trusted contacts at any time. You can also adjust their access levels and notification preferences whenever you want. It's your circle, you're in complete control."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if I travel or my routine changes temporarily?",
        "answer": "You can easily put SafeCircle in \"Away Mode\" to adjust monitoring parameters, or the system will naturally adapt to your new patterns within a day or two. You can also send a quick note to trusted contacts through the app explaining you'll be away."
