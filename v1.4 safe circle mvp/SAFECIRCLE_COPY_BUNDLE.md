> Choose what fits your situation

### Card 1: I Live Alone
**Icon:** Single person (User icon)

---

## Live Alone Landing

**Page:** `/live-alone`  
**User Context:** User selected "I live alone" - they are the person living independently  
**Audience:** Seniors/older adults who live alone, want to maintain independence but also be prepared

### Hero Section

**Main Headline:**
> Independence with preparation

**Subheadline:**
> Stay in control of your life while giving your loved ones reassurance—and clear guidance if they ever need to step in.

**CTA Buttons:**
- Get Started (primary)
- Why SafeCircle (secondary)

---

### Problem Section
**Section ID:** `problem`  
**User Context:** User is scrolling down to understand the problem SafeCircle solves

**Headline:**
> You want to stay in control—while being prepared

**Pain Points:**

**Point 1:**
> **I don't want to be unnoticed if something goes wrong.** If I fall ill or get injured at home, I want to know that someone would be alerted—without giving up my independence.

**Point 2:**
> **I don't want my loved ones left guessing.** If something happens, I want them to have clear guidance—not scramble to figure out what to do.

**Point 3:**
> **I know organizing is important, but it's easy to postpone.** Important details—accounts, recurring bills, contacts, preferences—are scattered. Getting them in one place feels like it can wait.

**Closing Statement (Italic):**
> You shouldn't have to choose between living independently and being prepared—for your own peace of mind and for the people who care about you.

---

### Wellbeing Monitor Section
**Section ID:** `wellbeing-monitor`  
**Product:** Product 1 of 2  
**User Context:** User is learning about the daily monitoring feature

**Section Headline:**
> Wellbeing monitor: Daily reassurance without checking in

**Section Subheadline:**
> Your trusted contacts know you're okay through quiet background monitoring. If your routine changes unexpectedly, they're notified automatically. No buttons to press, no devices to remember.

#### Feature Showcase 1 (Left-aligned screenshot)
**Headline:** You see daily confirmation that they are active and doing well  
**Description:** SafeCircle monitors activity patterns in the background. When everything is normal, you get quiet confirmation that they're going about their day.

#### Feature Showcase 2 (Right-aligned screenshot)
**Headline:** If something happens, the right people know  
**Description:** When a check-in is missed, trusted contacts are notified automatically — so help can reach you without guesswork or delay.

#### 3 Selling Points

**Benefit 1:**  
Title: Reassurance without losing independence  
Subtitle: works with what you already have

**Benefit 2:**  
Title: Quiet updates for your loved ones  
Subtitle: No daily check-in calls

**Benefit 3:**  
Title: Thoughtful alerts  
Subtitle: Peace of mind your way, with alerts tuned to your needs.

#### Learn More Expandable Section

**Button Text:** Learn more about how Wellbeing Monitor works

**How It Works:**

**Step 1:**
> SafeCircle learns your normal daily patterns using your phone and any smart devices you already have. It observes that activity is happening during your typical routine—not what you're doing or where you are.

**Step 2:**
> Each day, when your activity matches your normal pattern, SafeCircle automatically marks you as checked in. Your trusted contacts receive quiet confirmation that you're going about your day.

**Step 3:**
> If your routine changes significantly—for example, no activity is detected for an unusual length of time—SafeCircle waits a reasonable period, then alerts your trusted contacts. They can reach out to you directly.

**Step 4:**
> You can manually check in anytime, adjust your settings, or pause monitoring when you're traveling or your schedule changes.

**What This Is Not Section:**

**Not emergency services:**
> SafeCircle alerts your contacts, not 911. It's designed for peace of mind, not crisis response.

**Not medical monitoring:**
> It doesn't track health metrics, fall detection, or vital signs. It observes general activity patterns only.

**Not surveillance:**
> No cameras, no GPS tracking, no recording of what you're doing. Just pattern recognition from devices you already use.

### Legacy Planner Section
**Section ID:** `legacy-planner`  
**Product:** Product 2 of 2  
**User Context:** User is learning about the information organization feature

**Section Headline:**
> Legacy Planner: Everything organized, finally

**Section Subheadline:**
> One secure place for everything someone would need if something happened to you—financial accounts, important contacts, recurring bills, personal wishes. So your loved ones aren't left searching.

#### Feature Showcase (Left-aligned screenshot)
**Headline:** We guide you to make sure nothing's missed.  
**Description:** SafeCircle helps you build a complete list and makes filling it in as effortless as possible.

#### 3 Selling Points

**Benefit 1:**  
Title: Clarity instead of uncertainty  
Subtitle: Everything in one place

**Benefit 2:**  
Title: Fill in at your own pace  
Subtitle: No need to do it all at once

**Benefit 3:**  
Title: Private until needed  
Subtitle: You control access completely

#### Learn More Expandable Section

**Button Text:** Learn more about how Legacy Planner works

**How It Works:**

**Step 1:**
> The Legacy Planner is organized into clear categories: financial accounts, recurring bills, emergency contacts, legal documents, and personal wishes.

**Step 2:**
> You add information at your own pace. Start with essentials—maybe just your bank and a few contacts—then add more detail when you're ready. The app guides you through each category, so you don't have to figure out what's important.

**Step 3:**
> Everything is encrypted and stored securely. You control who gets access and when. Access can be granted immediately to trusted family members, or triggered only under specific conditions you define.

**Step 4:**
> You can update or revise information anytime. It's designed to evolve with your life, not be a one-time task.

**What This Is Not Section:**

**Not a legal will:**
> This organizes information, but doesn't replace estate planning documents. Think of it as the practical companion to your will—the details that are hard to find otherwise.

**Not automatically shared:**
> Nothing is visible to anyone unless you explicitly grant access. Your designated contacts can't see information until the conditions you set are met.

## Worry About Someone Landing

**Page:** `/worry-about-someone`  
**User Context:** User selected "I worry about someone" - they care about someone living alone  
**Audience:** Adult children, family members, friends worried about a loved one who lives alone

### Hero Section

**Main Headline:**
> Peace of mind for both of you

**Subheadline:**
> Stay connected with your loved one without constant check-ins. Know they're doing well—and be there quickly if something changes.

**CTA Buttons:**
- Get Started (primary)
- Why SafeCircle (secondary)

---

### Problem Section
**Section ID:** `problem`  
**User Context:** User is scrolling to understand the problem from the caregiver perspective

**Headline:**
> You want to know your parent or loved one is okay—without becoming their caretaker

**Pain Points:**

**Point 1:**
> **I worry, but I don't want to hover.** I care about a parent or loved one who lives alone, and the thought of them needing help—and no one knowing—keeps me up at night. But I don't want to become overbearing or intrusive.

**Point 2:**
> **I don't know what I'd need to do if something happens.** If my parent or loved one was suddenly hospitalized or incapacitated, I wouldn't know where to start. Bills, accounts, contacts—it would all be guesswork.

**Point 3:**
> **Daily check-ins feel like too much—for both of us.** I don't want them to feel monitored, and frankly, I don't always have time for daily calls.

**Closing Statement (Italic):**
> You shouldn't have to choose between respecting their independence and knowing they're safe.

---

### Wellbeing Monitor Section (Caregiver Version)
**Section ID:** `wellbeing-monitor`  
**User Context:** Same product, different messaging for caregiver perspective

**Section Headline:**
> Wellbeing monitor: Quiet reassurance, every day

**Section Subheadline:**
> Get daily confirmation that your loved one is active and doing well—without asking them to check in. If their routine changes unexpectedly, you're notified automatically.

#### Feature Showcase 1 (Left-aligned screenshot)
**Headline:** You see daily confirmation that they are active and doing well  
**Description:** SafeCircle monitors activity patterns in the background. When everything is normal, you get quiet confirmation that they're going about their day.

#### Feature Showcase 2 (Right-aligned screenshot)
**Headline:** If something happens, you know immediately  
**Description:** When a check-in is missed, you're notified automatically. No guessing, no delay—you can reach out or check in right away.

#### 3 Selling Points

**Benefit 1:**  
Title: Peace of mind without intrusion  
Subtitle: They keep their independence, you keep your peace of mind

**Benefit 2:**  
Title: No daily check-in calls  
Subtitle: Automatic updates save time for both of you

**Benefit 3:**  
Title: Immediate alerts when it matters  
Subtitle: You're notified right away if something's wrong

#### How It Works (Caregiver Version)

**Step 1:**
> Your loved one sets up SafeCircle using their phone and any smart devices they already have. The app learns their normal daily patterns over a few weeks.

**Step 2:**
> Each day, when their activity matches their normal pattern, you receive quiet confirmation. A simple status update shows they're active and doing well.

**Step 3:**
> If their routine changes significantly—for example, no activity for an unusual length of time—SafeCircle alerts you immediately. You can reach out to check on them right away.

**Step 4:**
> They can pause monitoring anytime if they're traveling or their schedule changes. No false alarms, no unnecessary worry.

**Section Headline:** Common Questions

**FAQs:**

**Q1: How do I get started with SafeCircle?**
> Download the SafeCircle app from the App Store or Google Play, create your account, and follow the guided setup to connect your devices and add trusted contacts. The entire process typically takes 10-15 minutes.

**Q2: What happens during the learning period?**
> SafeCircle spends the first 7-10 days learning your normal routines and patterns. During this time, the system observes your device usage but won't send alerts to trusted contacts. You'll receive progress updates as the system learns your patterns.

**Q3: How do I respond to a check-in notification?**
> When you receive a check-in notification, simply open the app and tap "I'm Fine" to confirm you're okay. You can also call or text your trusted contacts directly. If you don't respond within the specified time window, your contacts will be notified.

**Q4: Can I pause monitoring temporarily?**
> Yes! You can enable "Away Mode" in the app when traveling or if your routine changes significantly. This temporarily adjusts monitoring parameters. You can also send a quick message to your trusted contacts explaining you'll be away.

**Q5: How do I change my trusted contacts?**
> Go to Settings > Trusted Contacts in the app. You can add, remove, or modify contacts at any time. Changes take effect immediately, and you can adjust each contact's notification preferences and access levels individually.

**Q6: What if I need help setting up a specific device?**
> Our support team can help! Email support@safecircle.com or use the in-app chat feature. Include your device model, and we'll provide step-by-step guidance. We also have video tutorials for most popular devices in the app.

## Notes for Review

### Audience-Specific Copy Differences

The main difference between the two landing pages is the **perspective and pain points**:

**Live Alone Page:**
- First-person perspective ("I want...")
- Focus on maintaining independence while being prepared
- Emphasis on control and agency

**Worry About Someone Page:**
- Third-person perspective about loved one ("They...")
- Focus on getting reassurance without being intrusive
- Emphasis on knowing they're safe without hovering

### Product Messaging Consistency

Both products (Wellbeing Monitor and Legacy Planner) maintain consistent **functional descriptions** across both audiences, but the **benefit framing** shifts:

**Live Alone Version:**
- "Your trusted contacts know you're okay"
- "Help can reach you"

**Caregiver Version:**
- "You receive confirmation"
- "You're notified immediately"

### Key Messaging Themes Throughout

1. **Independence + Preparedness** (not either/or)
2. **Non-intrusive monitoring** (quiet, background, respectful)
3. **Peace of mind for both parties**
4. **No surveillance** (patterns only, not tracking)
5. **Flexible and in your control**
